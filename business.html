			<h3>Professional Attire</h3>
			<p>When either looking for a new job or presenting yourself as a 
				true professional, you always want to impress your counterpart.
				Knowing the general expectations for your professional attire
				is extremely important.  Follow the guidelines below to stay sharp.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Men - The business attire in Scotland is very similar to the United States.  Depending on the type of company, men may be seen wearing suits or dress shirts and slacks.  Tie is optional.</li>
				<li>Women â€“ Women also wear dress pants and a blouse or a sweater.  The season determines certain attire.  Wearing a skirt or a dress is acceptable, as long as it is not too short.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Negotiation Styles</h3>
			<p>In the world of business, negotiations are made daily.  You have to
				put yourself in the best position to win.  You can't win, respectfully, 
				if you do not know the rules of the game.  Here are some things to consider.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Most decisions made are made from the top of the chain and work their way down.</li>
				<li>Confrontation is avoided at all costs and most Scots, when closing a sale, pursue a softer selling technique.</li>
				<li>Negotiating of price in markets or shops is very rare in Scotland.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Dining Etiquette</h3>
			<p>Here are some tips when dining in Scotland.  It always pays to be
				prepared, especially when in the company of business partners and
				clients
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Except for when eating burgers or hotdogs, one should never eat with their hands.  From pizza to chicken, forks and knives are always used. </li>
				<li>Always hold your fork in your weak hand and your knife in your strong hand.   It is improper to switch your fork to your strong hand.</li>
				<li>Always carry a handkerchief for sneezing, burping, or wiping nose.</li>
				<li>Both hands should be visible at all times when at the dining table.</li>
				<li>If you are invited to a dinner party, it is tradition to never show up empty handed.  Common gifts are flowers, wine, and chocolates.</li>
				<li>If someone offers you a drink, it is considered rude to turn down a drink</li>
				<li>It is common courtesy to buy a round of drinks when out with a group of people.  However, it is customary that everyone take turns buying.</li>
