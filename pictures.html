			<p>Scotland is an absolute beautiful country.  It is here where you will find sights that are only unique to its region.  Where else
				on earth can you go to find so many beautiful castles?  The terrain in Scotland is certainly one to fall in love with.  With rolling
				hills, beautiful rock sculptures, and jaw dropping loche's, it is hard to imagine a more unique landscape.
			</p>
			<p>Below are some examples of Scotland's beauty</p>

			<h2>Queen's View over Loch Tummel</h2>
			<img src="images/queens.jpeg" alt="Queen's View" />
			<p>	Loch Tummel (Scottish Gaelic: Loch Teimhil) is a long, narrow loch, 6 miles northwest of Pitlochry in Perth and Kinross, Scotland.
				The loch is approximately 7 miles long from east to west, and about 1/2 mile wide. There are roads on both north and south banks, 
				offering splendid views of the surrounding countryside. The best is probably the well known 'Queen's View' from the north shore, 
				which Queen Victoria made famous in 1866, offering a magnificent view over the loch with Munro Schiehallion in the background.

			<h2>Eilean Donan Castle</h2>
			<img src="images/castle.jpeg" />
			<p>	Although the island of Eilean Donan has been a fortified site for 
				at least 800 years, the present building largely dates from the early 
				20th century. Today's castle, which rose from the ruins of its 
				predecessor, was re-built between 1912 and 1932 by Lieutenant Colonel 
				John MacRae-Gilstrap.

			<h2>Oban Harbour</h2>
			<img src="images/oban.jpeg" />
			<p>	Oban stands unchallenged as the capital of the western seaboard of 
				Scotland. It was a late starter, existing only as a small fishing and 
				trading village until the steamers of the early Victorian era started 
				arriving in ever greater numbers. It became the main point of departure 
				for the Western Isles and a regular stopping-off point for the steamers 
				linking Inverness with Glasgow via the Caledonian and Crinan canals. 
				And the arrival of the railway in 1880 only confirmed its growing status.
